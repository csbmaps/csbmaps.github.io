# Valentine's Day Inspired Basemap in Mapbox

This repository contains a Mapbox-hosted basemap in a Valentine's Day theme.

I chose a pink-based color pallate from [Coolers.co](https://coolors.co/f1e4e8-e2dcde-ceb1be-b97375-2d2d34) which was colorblind-friendly and included multiple dull tones that would suit a basemap well. the pink color was intended to reflect Valentine's Day, which happened last week :two_hearts:!

This basemap could be used to show popular destinations for dates or getaways that couples take on Valentine's Day. Those points could even be interactive to show details such as price :dollar: and wait time :clock130:.

I had trouble getting the map to load properly using the code format used in class, so I used the code provided in Mapbox. Sadly, this doesn't allow the attribution to be easily edited.
